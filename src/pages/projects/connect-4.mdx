import Button from '../../components/button'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Connect 4'
}

I created a Connect 4 game in TypeScript and React. The idea came about when a
teammate and I were looking for a good example project for learning about unit
testing. The initial idea seemed simple, but then we wondered _how exactly would
you write a function to see if a Connect 4 game has been won_?

<Button
  as='a'
  variant='large'
  href='https://github.com/juice49/connect-4'
  target='_blank'
  rel='noopener'
>
  Connect 4 on GitHub
</Button>
