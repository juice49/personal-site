I've been working on adding [JSON Feed](https://www.jsonfeed.org) to my blog, but I was surprised to discover that nobody has published JSON Feed TypeScript types yet. [So I made some](https://github.com/juice49/json-feed-types).

The types will give you confidence that your feed complies with the JSON Feed spec _and_ give you documentation from the spec itself in your editor. Pretty cool!

I've only typed version `1.1` of the spec so far. You can get the types from npm:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @json-feed-types/1_1
```

And then use them to type your feed data:

```js
import Feed from '@json-feed-types/1_1'

const feed: Feed = {
  version: 'https://jsonfeed.org/version/1.1',
  title: 'JSON Feed',
  icon: 'https://micro.blog/jsonfeed/avatar.jpg',
  home_page_url: 'https://www.jsonfeed.org/',
  feed_url: 'https://www.jsonfeed.org/feed.json',
  items: [

      title: 'JSON Feed version 1.1',
      content_html:
        '<p>We&rsquo;ve updated the spec to <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/version/1.1">version 1.1</a>. Itâ€™s a minor update to JSON Feed, clarifying a few things in the spec and adding a couple new fields such as <code>authors</code> and <code>language</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For version 1.1, we&rsquo;re starting to move to the more specific MIME type <code>application/feed+json</code>. Clients that parse HTML to discover feeds should prefer that MIME type, while still falling back to accepting <code>application/json</code> too.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/code/">code page</a> has also been updated with several new code libraries and apps that support JSON Feed.</p>\n',

    },
  ],
}
```

The types support extensions, too. You can [find out more in the readme](https://github.com/juice49/json-feed-types).
