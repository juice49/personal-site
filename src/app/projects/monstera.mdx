import button from '../../styles/button.css'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Monstera',
}

Monstera is a CSS-in-JS helper library. I created it because I really like Styled System, but I also really like CSS Custom Properties.

<a
  className={button({ variant: 'large' })}
  href='https://github.com/juice49/monstera'
  target='_blank'
  rel='noopener'
>
  Monstera on GitHub
</a>
